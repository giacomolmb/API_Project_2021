### Description of the Project

The aim of this project is to implement an efficient algorithm to calculate the total weight of undirected, weighted graphs and memorize them in an appropriate structure. The project has been evaluated through an automatic tester, keeping track of time spent and memory consumption for each test. 
The solution consists in the implementation of an optimized version of Dijkstra's Algorithm, that calculates the total cost of a graph represented in CSR and memorizes its weight into a Top K implemented as a Max Heap.
